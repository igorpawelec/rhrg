# The version must be one number, not three that agree by hand.
#
# CITATION.cff sat at 0.4.0 while DESCRIPTION said 0.4.2 -- two releases
# bumped one and not the other, because the bump was done by editing the
# places someone remembered instead of searching for the old number. The
# CITATION is what a DOI resolves to, so a stale one misattributes the work.
#
# This lives in tools/ and runs from the workflow rather than from tests/,
# because CITATION.cff is .Rbuildignore'd: under R CMD check it is not in
# the tarball at all, so a test there could only skip.
